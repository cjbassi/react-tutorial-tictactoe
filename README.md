Implements all 5 extra steps listed at the end of the React tutorial.
Includes some CSS changes, and the CSS has also been refactored to use [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).
The extra step were added pretty cleanly except for the last step; not sure if it could be impoved.
